# Hi there 👋 I'm Nassor Salum

Welcome to my professional portfolio. I am a dedicated **Petroleum Engineer** with experience in:

- 🛢️ Oil & gas extraction optimization  
- 🧪 Reservoir analysis and simulation  
- 🛠️ Drilling techniques & well performance  
- 📊 Production enhancement strategies  
- 🧰 Tools: PETREL, Eclipse, CMG, Python, MATLAB, ANSYS Mechanical, Excel

## 📂 Projects
- 🔍 **Structural & Property Upscaling for Reservoir Simulation** — Modeled resevoir structures and properties, using Petrel and Eclipse, compared recovery factors under various scenarios.
 ### 🧱 [Structural & Property Upscaling for Reservoir Simulation](https://github.com/nassor-salum/structural-property-upscaling)  
*Petrel, Eclipse – Grid Resolution, Property Upscaling, Simulation*

Performed structural grid refinement (coarse to fine) and property upscaling (porosity, permeability). Used Petrel for geological and grid modeling, then ran simulations in Eclipse to analyze the production behavior post-upscaling. The project focused on enhancing simulation reliability and interpreting production trends.

- 🛠️ **Drilling Optimization Design** — Developed a drilling program reducing NPT by 15% in directional wells.
- 📈 **Production Data Analysis** — Applied decline curve analysis using Excel and Python and nodal anlysis using Petrel to forecast production.
